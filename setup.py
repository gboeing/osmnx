**OSMnx** is a Python package that lets you download spatial data and
model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks from
OpenStreetMap's APIs. Users can download and model walkable, drivable, or
bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily
analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with
amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street
bearings/orientations, speed/travel time, and network routing.
