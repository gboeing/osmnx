OSMnx documentation build configuration file.

Created by sphinx-quickstart on Sun Feb  4 13:53:34 2018.
This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its
containing dir.

Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
autogenerated file.

All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
serve to show the default.

If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
documentation root, use Path.resolve() to make it absolute, like shown here.
