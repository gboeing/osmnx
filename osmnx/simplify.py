def is_endpoint(G, node, strict=True):
    """
    Return True if the node is a "real" endpoint of an edge in the network, \
    otherwise False. OSM data includes lots of nodes that exist only as points \
    to help streets bend around curves. An end point is a node that either: \
    1) is its own neighbor, ie, it self-loops. \
    2) or, has no incoming edges or no outgoing edges, ie, all its incident \
        edges point inward or all its incident edges point outward. \
    3) or, it does not have exactly two neighbors and degree of 2 or 4. \
    4) or, if strict mode is false, if its edges have different OSM IDs. \

    Clean-up intersections comprising clusters of nodes by merging them and

    Divided roads are represented by separate centerline edges. The intersection

    intersection in the real world. This function cleans them up by buffering
    their points to an arbitrary distance, merging overlapping buffers, and
    taking their centroid. For best results, the tolerance argument should be
