    Determine if a node is a true endpoint of an edge.

    Return True if the node is a "true" endpoint of an edge in the network,
    otherwise False. OpenStreetMap data includes many nodes that exist only as
    geometric vertices to allow ways to curve. `node` is a true edge endpoint
    if it satisfies at least 1 of the following 5 rules:

    1) It is its own neighbor (ie, it self-loops).

    2) Or, it has no incoming edges or no outgoing edges (ie, all its incident
    edges are inbound or all its incident edges are outbound).

    3) Or, it does not have exactly two neighbors and degree of 2 or 4.

    4) Or, if `node_attrs_include` is not None and it has one or more of the
    attributes in `node_attrs_include`.

    5) Or, if `edge_attrs_differ` is not None and its incident edges have
    different values than each other for any of the edge attributes in

    Simplify a graph's topology by removing interstitial nodes.

    https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.70037

    This simplifies the graph's topology by removing all nodes that are not
    intersections or dead-ends, by creating an edge directly between the end
    points that encapsulate them while retaining the full geometry of the
    original edges, saved as a new `geometry` attribute on the new edge.

    Note that only simplified edges receive a `geometry` attribute. Some of
    the resulting consolidated edges may comprise multiple OSM ways, and if
    so, their unique attribute values are stored as a list. Optionally, the
    simplified edges can receive a `merged_edges` attribute that contains a
    list of all the `(u, v)` node pairs that were merged together.

    Use the `node_attrs_include` or `edge_attrs_differ` parameters to relax
    simplification strictness. For example, `edge_attrs_differ=["osmid"]` will
    retain every node whose incident edges have different OSM IDs. This lets
    you keep nodes at elbow two-way intersections (but be aware that sometimes
    individual blocks have multiple OSM IDs within them too). You could also
    use this parameter to retain nodes where sidewalks or bike lanes begin/end
    in the middle of a block. Or for example, `node_attrs_include=["highway"]`
    will retain every node with a "highway" attribute (regardless of its
    value), even if it does not represent a street junction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G

    node_attrs_include
        Node attribute names for relaxing the strictness of endpoint

    edge_attrs_differ
        Edge attribute names for relaxing the strictness of endpoint
        determination. A node is always an endpoint if its incident edges have
        different values than each other for any attribute in
        `edge_attrs_differ`.
    remove_rings
        If True, remove any graph components that consist only of a single
        chordless cycle (i.e., an isolated self-contained ring).
    track_merged
        If True, add `merged_edges` attribute on simplified edges, containing
        a list of all the `(u, v)` node pairs that were merged together.
    edge_attr_aggs
        Allows user to aggregate edge segment attributes when simplifying an
        edge. Keys are edge attribute names and values are aggregation
        functions to apply to these attributes when they exist for a set of
        edges being merged. Edge attributes not in `edge_attr_aggs` will

    Merges nearby nodes and returns either their centroids or a rebuilt graph
    with consolidated intersections and reconnected edge geometries. The
    `tolerance` argument can be a single value applied to all nodes or
    individual per-node values. It should be adjusted to approximately match
    street design standards in the specific street network, and you should use
    a projected graph to work in meaningful and consistent units like meters.
    Note: `tolerance` represents a per-node buffering radius. For example, to
    consolidate nodes within 10 meters of each other, use `tolerance=5`.

    When `rebuild_graph` is False, it uses a purely geometric (and relatively
    fast) algorithm to identify "geometrically close" nodes, merge them, and
    return the merged intersections' centroids. When `rebuild_graph` is True,
    it uses a topological (and slower but more accurate) algorithm to identify
    "topologically close" nodes, merge them, then rebuild/return the graph.
    Returned graph's node IDs represent clusters rather than "osmid" values.
    Refer to nodes' "osmid_original" attributes for original "osmid" values.
    If multiple nodes were merged together, the "osmid_original" attribute is
    a list of merged nodes' "osmid" values.

    Divided roads are often represented by separate centerline edges. The
    intersection of two divided roads thus creates 4 nodes, representing where
    each edge intersects a perpendicular edge. These 4 nodes represent a
    single intersection in the real world. A similar situation occurs with
    roundabouts and traffic circles. This function consolidates nearby nodes
    by buffering them to an arbitrary distance, merging overlapping buffers,
    and taking their centroid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G
        A projected graph.
    tolerance
        Nodes are buffered to this distance (in graph's geometry's units) and
        subsequent overlaps are dissolved into a single node. If scalar, then
        that single value will be used for all nodes. If dict (mapping node
        IDs to individual values), then those values will be used per node and
        any missing node IDs will not be buffered.
    rebuild_graph
        If True, consolidate the nodes topologically, rebuild the graph, and
        return as MultiDiGraph. Otherwise, consolidate the nodes geometrically
        and return the consolidated node points as GeoSeries.
    dead_ends
        If False, discard dead-end nodes to return only street-intersection
        points.
    reconnect_edges
        If True, reconnect edges (and their geometries) to the consolidated
        nodes in rebuilt graph, and update the edge length attributes. If
        False, the returned graph has no edges (which is faster if you just
        need topologically consolidated intersection counts). Ignored if
        `rebuild_graph` is not True.
    node_attr_aggs
        Allows user to aggregate node attributes values when merging nodes.
        Keys are node attribute names and values are aggregation functions
        (anything accepted as an argument by `pandas.agg`). Node attributes
        not in `node_attr_aggs` will contain the unique values across the
        merged nodes. If None, defaults to `{"elevation": numpy.mean}`.

    Returns
    -------
    Gc or gs
        If `rebuild_graph=True`, returns MultiDiGraph with consolidated
        intersections and (optionally) reconnected edge geometries. If

    Consolidate intersections comprising clusters of nearby nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G
        A projected graph.
    tolerance
        Nodes are buffered to this distance (in graph's geometry's units) and

    reconnect_edges
        If True, reconnect edges (and their geometries) to the consolidated
        nodes in rebuilt graph, and update the edge length attributes. If
        False, the returned graph has no edges (which is faster if you just
        need topologically consolidated intersection counts).
    node_attr_aggs
        Allows user to aggregate node attributes values when merging nodes.
        Keys are node attribute names and values are aggregation functions
        (anything accepted as an argument by `pandas.agg`). Node attributes
        not in `node_attr_aggs` will contain the unique values across the
