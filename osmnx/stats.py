def basic_stats(G, area=None, clean_intersects=False, tolerance=15,

    """
    Calculate basic descriptive metric and topological stats for a graph.

    For an unprojected lat-lng graph, tolerance and graph units should be in
    degrees, and circuity_dist should be 'gc'. For a projected graph, tolerance
    and graph units should be in meters (or similar) and circuity_dist should be
    'euclidean'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx multidigraph
    area : numeric
        the area covered by the street network, in square meters (typically land
        area); if none, will skip all density-based metrics
    clean_intersects : bool
        if True, calculate clean intersections count (and density, if area is
        provided)
    tolerance : numeric
        tolerance value passed along if clean_intersects=True, see
        clean_intersections() function documentation for details and usage
    circuity_dist : str
        'gc' or 'euclidean', how to calculate straight-line distances for
        circuity measurement; use former for lat-lng networks and latter for
        projected networks
