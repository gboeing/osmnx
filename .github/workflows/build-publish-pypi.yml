# This workflow builds the Python package distribution and uploads it to PyPI
# if the triggering event was a tag push. When it's a scheduled run, it just
# builds the distribution as a test, but does not upload it. The upload uses
# PyPI trusted publishing, so don't change this workflow's filename.
